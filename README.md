## About me

I am a programmer, graphic designer, game developer, cool friend and the sole developer of Midelight.  
I love network things like servers and cool data. ;p  
I often take the position as leader and can manage different communities very well.  
I also have quite the experience, I started making After Effects animations when I was 10  
then when I was 13 years old I created [WriteNote](https://midelight.net/WriteNote). Which today I have expanded and worked a lot on.

## Iâ€™m looking forward to

Finishing all of my projects.  
Making a video game!
